# HPC4WC_Project12_AI_assited_optimization

## The project description: 

Using AI assistants of your choice (ChatGPT, CoPilot,   …) you try to replace yourselves as performance engineers. Explore porting to other programming languages (C/C++, Julia, …), porting to GPUs (OpenACC, CUDA, …), parallelizing (OpenMP, MPI, …), and optimizing the naive stencil2d.F90 code.
