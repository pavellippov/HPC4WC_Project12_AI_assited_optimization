# HPC4WC_Project12_AI_assited_optimization

## The project description: 

Using AI assistants of your choice (ChatGPT, CoPilot,   …) you try to replace yourselves as performance engineers. Explore porting to other programming languages (C/C++, Julia, …), porting to GPUs (OpenACC, CUDA, …), parallelizing (OpenMP, MPI, …), and optimizing the naive stencil2d.F90 code.

## How to run

This code should be copied into your home directory (neighboring the `HPC4WC`). It uses the same kernel that was created by `HPC4WC`, so first need to follow instructions at https://github.com/ofuhrer/HPC4WC/tree/main . 

Then the code follows the notebook `ai_optimization_performance_analysis.ipynb`. 

You can also clone it from https://github.com/pavellippov/HPC4WC_Project12_AI_assited_optimization/tree/main (once again into the neighboring folder of `HPC4WC`).
